Fork of VLC media player for Vocalys
===============================

Note : Please clone the repository directly. Don't use it as submodule, it would probably block the "make" step.

git clone git@github.com:Vocalys/vlc.git

DO NOT FORGET TO SWITCH TO THE CORRECT GIT BRANCH

git checkout 2.2.0-git-Vocalys-API

How to install VLC:
sudo apt-get install git libtool build-essential pkg-config autoconf lua5.1

Execute this line only if you are under ubuntu:
sudo apt-get build-dep vlc

./bootstrap
./configure
make
./vlc

If you are not under ubuntu you may have more problems:
The compilation with make will raises missing libraries issues. Install them one by one.
You can use the contrib solution. However, it does not work on every linux distribution.
