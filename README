Fork of VLC media player for Vocalys
===============================

How to install VLC:
sudo apt-get install git libtool build-essential pkg-config autoconf lua5.1

Execute this line only if you are under ubuntu:
sudo apt-get build-dep vlc

./bootstrap
./configure
make
./vlc

If you are not under ubuntu you may have more problems:
The compilation with make will raises missing libraries issues. Install them one by one.
You can use the contrib solution. However, it does not work on every linux distribution.
